Fullstack Application - Restaurant Reservation

Project Pitch: The aim of this web application is to provide the user with an internal restaurant management site. The functionality of this site allows a user to schedule a new reservation, create a new table to seat guests at, look up past and current reservations by phone number, and keep track of who is seated at what table. This is a fullstack application utilizing React, Bootstrap, Node.js, express, and knex.

User Stories: As a user, I should be able to:
* View todays reservations and available tables at the /dashboard route.
* Create a new reservation when a guest calls in at the reservations/new route.
* Look up customers and their past reservations at the /search route.
* Create a new table to seat guests at, at the tables/new route.
