### User Story Summaries 
### _As a restaurant manager, I want to be able to do the following:_
> Create a new reservation when a customer calls.                                                                                                                                 
> Allow reservations to be created only days with the restaurant is open.                        
> Allow reservations to be created to accommodate guests during business hours.                                                                                             
> Seat a customer with an existing reservation at a specific table.  
> Free an occupied table in the system when the customer leaves.                                                                                                     
> Apply a status of either booked, seated, or finished to each reservation.                                                                                                    
> Search for a reservation by phone number (partial or complete).
